# covid19_us_data
Simple analysis using U.S covid 19 data. Infectious diseases spread exponentially hence I compare the number of cases today from the number of cases from the previous day (growth ratio). I graphed the data over time and calculated the percentage increase in order to see if we have reached an inflection rate.
